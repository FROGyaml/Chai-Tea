# Mint tea
Adds Quake-style bunnyhopping to the game.

Largely inspired by [Squake](https://github.com/squeek502/Squake), both in idea and implementation.

For movement reference, consult the [fortress forever wiki](http://www.fortress-forever.com/wiki/index.php?title=Category:Movement_Systems). Only bunnyhopping is currently implemented.
